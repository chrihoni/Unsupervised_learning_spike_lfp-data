# Unsupervised_learning_spike_lfp_data
Unsupervised learning routines for sorting of brain signals including extracellular spikes and local field potentials.

Electrodes inserted into brain tissue ususally pick up extracellular signals from different neurons in the vicinity of each electrode. In order to isolate the activity of a single neuron extracellular spikes are sorted according to the shape of spike waveforms. A variety of algorithms/packages have been proposed for spike sorting including unsupervised learning using PCA followed by k-Means clustering. (https://medium.com/towards-data-science/whos-talking-using-k-means-clustering-to-sort-neural-events-in-python-e7a8a76f316).

To evaluate the performance of spike sorting algorithms including unsupervised learning procedures we need ground truth data but those are usually not available. We can take advantage of MEArec (https://mearec.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html) a Python package for fast and customizable biophysical simulation of extracellular recordings, to first simulate ground truth data followed by evaluation of our unsupervised sorting approach. The notebook [mearec](https://github.com/chrihoni/Unsupervised_learning_spike_lfp-data/blob/main/mearec.ipynb) shows how to simulate spike data using the MEArec package. After simulation of the ground truth data we use PCA in combination with the k-means algorithm to evaluate the performance of this unsupervised cluster technique [machine_learning_spike_sorting_unsupervised]https://github.com/chrihoni/Unsupervised_learning_spike_lfp-data/blob/main/machine_learning_spike_sorting_unsupervised.ipynb.
